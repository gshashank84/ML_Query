Why the cost function is computed for all the training sets whereas the square loss function is computed for each training sets?
shape of w?

Why TanH function is used over to sigmoid function as an activation function ?
-- The tanh activation usually works better than sigmoid activation function for hidden units because the mean of its output is closer to zero, and so it centers the data better for the next layer.

Why we initialize weights randomly rather than initializing it to zero?
-- Logistic regression’s weights w should be initialized randomly rather than to all zeros, because if you initialize to all zeros, then logistic regression will fail to learn a useful decision boundary because it will fail to “break symmetry”.
